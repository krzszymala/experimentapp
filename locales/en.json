    "info_text": "My name is Krzysztof Szymała, and I am a cognitive science student at the University of Silesia in Katowice. My research concerns differences in the perception of visual stimuli between meditating and non-meditating individuals. This study is part of my master's thesis, titled \"Effects of meditation techniques on selected human cognitive processes.\" Participation in this study will help explore the impact of meditation on our perceptual abilities. Your decision to participate in this study is entirely voluntary, and you may withdraw at any time without giving a reason. All data collected during the study will be treated confidentially and used exclusively for scientific purposes. The results will be analyzed in an aggregated form, meaning that individual participant data will not be disclosed. Participation in the study involves no risks, and the information obtained may contribute to a better understanding of how meditation affects cognitive processes.",
