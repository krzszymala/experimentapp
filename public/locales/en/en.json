My research concerns differences in the perception of visual stimuli between meditating and non-meditating individuals. It is part of my master's thesis, titled 'The influence of meditation techniques on selected cognitive processes in humans.' Participation in the study will help in exploring the impact of meditation on our perceptual abilities.",
